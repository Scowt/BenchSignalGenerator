# BenchSignalGenerator
 Basic signal generator

This is intended to be a benchtop signal generator.

Intended microcontroller is at this stage an stm32, so I can build some experience with different toolchains.

Intended wave generator IC is the AD9834, 75Mhz version.

Intended use: personal.

Intended outcome: 	Ability to generate arbitrary (square, triangle, sawtooth, sine) waveforms. 

Should be able to select amplitude, frequency, offset.


UI: Likely to be a basic display (have spare lcds)

Likely to use rotary encoders (potentially one encoder, and use buttons to select for amplitude/frequency/offset?)


This project is very much intended to be a simple self-learning project.
