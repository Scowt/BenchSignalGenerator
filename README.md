# BenchSignalGenerator
 Basic signal generator

This is intended to be a benchtop signal generator.
Intended microcontroller is at this stage an stm32, so I can build some experience.
Intended wave generator IC is the AD9834, 75Mhz version.
Intended use: personal.
Intended outcome: 	Ability to generate arbitrary (square, triangle, sawtooth, sine) waveforms. 
					Should be able to select amplitude, frequency.
